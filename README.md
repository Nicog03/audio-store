# audio-store

This project aims to emulate a virtual store focused on audio related products, in which the user can browse a catalog of items, visualizing reviews made by other users and even add products to a cart, which will take into account the price of all the products within it and present the sum of all values. It's is also possible for the user to create an account on the site using either its email or google account.

The main idea here was to create an application which would make use of all the knowledge obtained on the Compass UOL's scholarship program. The objective was to recreate a figma design following a mobile-first pattern of design as well as the best practices on a development environment.
